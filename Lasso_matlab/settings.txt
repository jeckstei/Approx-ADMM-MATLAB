datasets.mat: contains all the cancer datasets we use for tests.

cancer_datasets.mat: contains datasets.mat plus numerical results for normalized data those parameters:
                     c = 1
                     1/c = 0.1
                     sigma = 0.99
                     ita = 1
                     beta = 10
                     epsilon = 1e-6

cancer_datasets_without_norm.mat: contains datasets.mat and numerical results for original datasets (without normalization)
                                c = 100
                                1/c = 0.01
                                sigma = 0.99
                                ita = 1
                                beta = 10
                                epsilon = 1e-6
